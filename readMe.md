# Pknm QUIZ Website made by Harri Taylor

For my Second portfolio project 2 I have chosen to do a pokemon type quiz, this project is fairly new and i hope to finsih it more soon.

my target audience would be old and young as the game that I used as a foundation was very nostalgic to me back in the early 2000s

"ALL CODE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR THE RESUBMISSION DATE"

other repository data still needs to be accounted for
